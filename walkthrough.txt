Forest edge
At the edge of the woods under bright moonlight stands a vast crumbling castle. A winding path meanders ahead to the front door. Near the path is a large friendly sign.
Transcript mode on.

Front Door
A dark oak slab of door hangs on wide iron hinges. Perched high above on the wall is a gargoyle, making a goofy smirk.
Next to the door is a cheery little doorbell.
> push doorbell (p key)
A merry chime rings from inside the castle.
Moments later, a staticky speaker comes to life inside the gargoyle above your head:
“Greetings adventurer! No doubt you've come to plunder this dangerous castle for treasure. To make you feel welcome, enjoy this very safe (and not poisoned) ice cream cone.”
A small hatch opens near the door, and a stone hand emerges holding a delicious ice cream cone.
[Press L to lick, S to sniff, or P to push the ice cream cone away.]
> refuse the ice cream cone (p key)
“Hey!” crackles the gargoyle speaker. “Why would anyone refuse free ice cream? It's irresistible!”
The speaker emits a loud, disgusting slurp. “Delicious! Hey, let me get that door for you.”
Seconds later the door swings open.

BOOM! The cannon thunders and a HUGE cannonball fires into the air!
The cannonball sails through the window of the next tower over, followed by a loud thundering CRASH!
Moments later a cheerful owl flaps into the room. “Thank you, kind adventurer!” hoots the owl. “Because of you, I am free of that loathsome cage.” He drops a whistle into your open palm. “In this castle are many diabolical traps and puzzles. Should you encounter a riddle beyond your comprehension, blow this whistle and I will come assist. Farewell!”
He flaps off into the night.
[You can now press 'w' to blow the whistle.]

This is a foul, tight little space, as though some very unhygienic animal has made it's home in here.
