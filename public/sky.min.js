    You've never read about me in the papers, or in any journal. You can
    call me Madame Soo. Sometimes, at Scotland Yard, they call me the China Doll.
    They are not entirely a bad lot, I suppose. But when the police find 
    themselves truly baffled, they come to me.

    Thus, when there was an urgent knock on the door of my small parlour off West India Dock Road, I knew precisely who

    Chief Inspector Gould's face appeared in the dim moonlight.
    "Good evening, Madame Soo," he said, entering as
    swiftly as he could and shutting the door behind him.

    "Captain Bennett, of the Queen's navy?" I replied.

    "The same," said Gould, "Though he was more a privateer than the navy man you've read about in the papers.
    Bennett was a bachelor, living with a housekeeper and a gardener. At about half past six this evening he retired to his

      Soon our hansom arrived at the gate of a wide rolling lawn, blue under the light of the moon. Beyond the lawn

      We stood on a wide stone porch in nearly total darkness. The door swung open to reveal

      Mrs. Werstrom found the body?"

      "Yes," nodded Gould.

      "How do we know she isn't the murderer?"

      "The 90 pound, 60-year old housekeeper managed to choke the still-robust captain of
