        Yates is (literally) your second hand man; a 50/50 medley of robotic and organic components, cobbled into a hodge-podge of an android. 
        The bio stuff is cut-rate, to say the least, likely because he sustains every six hours or so with junk food and their abundant hydrocarbons.
        Thus, he constantly smells vaguely of processed cheese dust.
    
        He peers blandly at you from beneath the hull.
